# PowerShell Gadgets

## Project Overview

This project is a proof of concept to demonstrate how to use PowerShell with a FTDI FT232H board, like the Adafruit FT232H breakout board, to interface with various IoT devices, sensors, outputs, and accessories.  

To expand the capabilities of this project, wireless communication is necessary. Since the FT232H chip does not natively support wireless communication, we'll use an ESP32, like the WaveShare ESP32-S3 board, to handle WiFi and ESP-Now communication with peripheral modules and devices.

## Compatibility

Some capabilities work with PowerShell 5.1, but the majority of the features require PowerShell 7.x or later.

## Example: Reading serial port stream from multiple wireless psgadget-io devices
