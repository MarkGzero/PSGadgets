To make UART communication asynchronous and bidirectional between your PC and the ESP32, you can use Python’s `asyncio` library to handle both sending and receiving messages asynchronously. Here’s how you can approach it:

1. **Run UART Communication Asynchronously**: By setting up separate asynchronous tasks, you can ensure that the ESP32 can handle both incoming and outgoing UART messages independently. This allows your ESP32 to listen for messages over UART while also processing any received messages and sending responses as needed.

2. **Define Asynchronous UART Read and Write Functions**: Define async functions to handle reading from and writing to the UART interface. Since MicroPython lacks native `asyncio` support for UART, use a workaround by polling the UART interface periodically.

3. **ESP32 Code Adjustments**:
   - Split the UART communication functions to handle sending and receiving independently.
   - Modify the main loop to run these UART tasks alongside the existing ESP-NOW broadcast and reception logic.

Here's an example of how you might update your code:

```python
import network
import espnow
import ubinascii
import time
import uasyncio as asyncio  # For async support
from machine import Pin, UART
import neopixel

# Constants
CTSSID = "PsGadget-CT"
MACFILE = "known_devices.txt"
BROADCAST_MAC = b'\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF'

# Initialize UART, NeoPixel, and Wi-Fi in station mode
uart = UART(1, baudrate=9600, tx=Pin(5), rx=Pin(6))
wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
wlan.active(True)
esp_now = espnow.ESPNow()
esp_now.active(True)
np = neopixel.NeoPixel(Pin(21, Pin.OUT), 1)

# Ensure LED is off at the start
np[0] = (0, 0, 0)
np.write()

# Add the broadcast MAC address as a peer
try:
    esp_now.add_peer(BROADCAST_MAC)
except Exception as e:
    print("Failed to add broadcast peer:", e)

# Function to broadcast message periodically
async def broadcast_task():
    while True:
        try:
            mac = ubinascii.hexlify(wlan.config("mac"), ":").decode()
            message = f"{mac}:{wlan.config('essid') or CTSSID}"
            esp_now.send(BROADCAST_MAC, message.encode('utf-8'))
        except Exception as e:
            print("Failed to send broadcast message:", e)
        await asyncio.sleep(5)

# Function to handle UART receiving
async def uart_receive_task():
    while True:
        if uart.any():  # Check if data is available on UART
            message = uart.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
            print(f"Received over UART: {message}")
            if message == "status":
                # Respond with some status if requested
                uart.write("ESP32 status: Active\n")
            # Handle other commands or logic as needed
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # Small delay to prevent busy waiting

# Function to send message over UART
async def uart_send_task(message):
    try:
        uart.write(message + "\n")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to send message over UART: {e}")

# Function to handle received ESP-NOW messages
def espnow_callback(_):
    try:
        mac, espnowmsg = esp_now.recv()
        mac_str = ubinascii.hexlify(mac, ":").decode()
        print(f"Received ESP-NOW message from {mac_str}: {espnowmsg}")
        
        message_str = espnowmsg.decode('utf-8').split('|')
        if len(message_str) < 6:
            print("Malformed ESP-NOW message received.")
            return

        gadget_type, serial_number, machine_type, cpu_temperature, battery_status, message = message_str
        print(f"Decoded ESP-NOW message: {message_str}")

        # Send message over UART with a newline to mark the end of the message
        asyncio.create_task(uart_send_task(espnowmsg.decode('utf-8')))

        # Blink LED if RGB message is received
        if message.startswith('rgb'):
            blink_led(message)
            
    except Exception as e:
        print("Failed to process ESP-NOW message:", e)

# Helper function to blink LED
def blink_led(message):
    try:
        rgb_str = message[3:].strip("()")
        rgb = tuple(map(int, rgb_str.split(',')))
        np[0] = rgb
        np.write()
        time.sleep(1)
        np[0] = (0, 0, 0)
        np.write()
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid RGB format in message.")

# Register callback for ESP-NOW
esp_now.irq(espnow_callback)

# Main function to start tasks
async def main():
    print("Starting UART and ESP-NOW tasks...")
    await asyncio.gather(broadcast_task(), uart_receive_task())

# Run main event loop
try:
    asyncio.run(main())
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Program interrupted")
```

### Key Updates:
1. **Broadcast Task**: An asynchronous task (`broadcast_task()`) repeatedly sends broadcast messages every 5 seconds.
2. **UART Receive Task**: The `uart_receive_task()` function reads incoming UART data every 0.1 seconds and processes it.
3. **UART Send Task**: An async function `uart_send_task(message)` handles sending messages over UART when called (e.g., triggered by ESP-NOW message receipt).
4. **ESP-NOW Callback**: The callback `espnow_callback` decodes received ESP-NOW messages, processes them, and schedules UART messages to be sent asynchronously.

This structure allows both broadcast and UART communication to run independently without blocking each other, enabling bidirectional UART communication with your ESP32 asynchronously. 

On the **PC side**, you can use a Python script with `asyncio` and `serial_asyncio` to communicate with the ESP32 UART port, enabling true bidirectional, asynchronous communication between the two devices.
